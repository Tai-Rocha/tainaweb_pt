<!-- this is a subheadline -->
<div style="text-align: justify"> I'm a driven 30-something Brazil from Pará and biodiversity researcher! Through this website, I'll share content as science communication, tutorials,  talks,  diverse themes about science and cute things :purple_heart: It's in an ​early stage and despite choosing English to begin, I intend as soon as possible to provide content in Portuguese and Spanish. Although having a common language is important for science communication, provide multilingual alternatives promotes equity, inclusion and diversity in the scientific community and beyond that. Not least important, all content including the code to build this website is open and available on Github. I advocate for open science, thus my tools are open-source.</div>
