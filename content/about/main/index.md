 <div style="text-align: justify"> I was lucky to make all my scientific education in Amazon region institutions then I moved to Rio de Janeiro to finish my Ph.D and geared my subsequent research towards the spatial analysis of biodiversity, focusing on the impact of global change (climate change and land-use and land-cover changes). 
 
  Ps.: Want to know how to say my name? There is an audio of my name in the right sidebar!
  
  ### What I'm up to lately... beyond the research
 Iâ€™m an R programming enthusiast (#rstats) ! A also love Github and its features. I usually spend Sundays reading books and drinking coffee or tea. I like good dishes and drinks, beaches and hot weather.
 
 Fighting against Bolsonaro's Government!</div>
